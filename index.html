          <h2><span>Can you have two directives</span> on the same element?</h2>

          <div class="img"><img src="images/img1.jpg" width="638" height="192" alt="" class="fl" /></div>
          <div class="post_content">
            <p>
              
              <p>The answer is: Yes you can.</p>
              <p>But it is not that simple.</p>
              <p>I came across to have to render a map on one page and render another with a route on it on another page; of course it can be done by coping code from the first page to the second one, and then adding the route. However, it would totally violate DRY (don’t repeat yourself) rule. </p>

              <p>Here enters directive, the major tool that deals with dom manipulation in angular, and it is reusable. However, if you put two directives in one element, you would probably have the following error:</p>

              <p>Why Angular doesn’t like two directives asking for the same scope on the same element? The reasons can be:</p>
              <p>1.  Angular doesn’t know which directive comes first;</p>
              <p>2.  Angular doesn’t know what to do with the dom rendered by the first directive.
              To fix </p>

              <p>The first can be addressed by changing the <em>‘priority’</em> property of directives. The higher the value, the earlier the directive will get executed. If one directive has to operate before another, this property has to be set accordingly.</p>

              <p>The other is trickier; once you’ve decided which directive is the first (let’s call it Drt A), you also have to decide how the directives interact with each other. If you want the dom created by second one (Drt B) to replace that by Drt A, set the <em>‘replace’</em> property of Drt B to ‘true’. Otherwise, don’t do anything on it (which is defaulted to be ‘false’). </p>

              <p>Of course, when you put two directives together, it is because you want to reuse the product of Drt A on Drt B; the key here is the property <em>‘transclude’</em> (a buzz-word that isn’t even included in the Oxford Dictionary). ‘Transclude’ indicates whether the new directive is going to accept and be able to use the dom in the original directive. Clearly, you have to set ‘transclude’ to be true in Drt B.</p>

              <p>This is not the end of the story. Planning what to put under the controller function or the link function is equally important. In directive, the controller function is responsible for before the compilation while the link is for after. In our case, we want to pass some information in the scope from Drt A to Drt B, so it is critical to writing codes under the controller of the former; or else, the scope can’t pass the information as needed. Then in Drt B, just manipulate your scope under link, and <strong>Done!</strong></p>

          <h2><span>$scope: to pass or not?</span> This is the question. </h2>
          <p class="infopost">Posted on <span class="date">29 MAR 2014</span>
          <div class="clr"></div>
          <div class="img"><img src="images/img2.jpg" width="638" height="192" alt="" class="fl" /></div>
          <div class="post_content">
            <p>$scope: to pass or not? This is the question.</p>
            <p>When I first started writing program under Angularjs framework, I used the angular seed structure to organize my files; this is a bad idea. As your program becomes bigger and more complex, you have to adopt a more modular organization or your single controller file will become too overwhelmingly long and unreadable.</p>
              <p>However, another problem arises: how can I pass a scope from controller to others? I first did it by putting lots of my information in my rootscope. Again, a bad practice. 
              Of course, in angular rootscope is created as the variable closest to the global scope and is meant for passing information. And that is it. However, more often than not, we pass information so that we can manipulate the data; using rootscope for this purpose is a total no-no; as according to the documentation of Angular (FAQ session):</p>
              <p>“Of course, global state sucks and you should use $rootScope sparingly, like you would (hopefully) use with global variables in any language. In particular, don't use it for code, only data. If you're tempted to put a function on $rootScope, it's almost always better to put it in a service that can be injected where it's needed, and more easily tested.</p>
              <p>Conversely, don't create a service whose only purpose in life is to store and return bits of data.”</p>
              <p>So what can we do to pass scope between controllers? First, depends on your structure, you can employ the built-in event listener of $emit, $on and $broadcast. From the source controller, use $emit (if source is a child to the receiver) or $broadcast (if source is a parent) to dispatch the information to the receiver controller, which should use $on to listen.</p>
              <p>Another way is just create service for passing information.</p>  
              <div class="code">
              <p>angular.module('servicePassScope', [])
                .service('passScope', function(){
                    var storage = {};
                    var store = function(info, key){
                        storage.key = info;
                    };

                    var retrieve= function(key){
                        return storage.key;
                    };

                    return {store: store, retrieve: retrieve};
                });</p>
                </div>

              <p>Such service is easy to write and handy to use. Besides keeping your rootscope clean, another benefit is this information can be directly available to your other services, which cannot inject with $scope.</p>
